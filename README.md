1st coursework for KCL's 1st year CS programming module (PPA). Grade: First (78%)

A simple property viewer created in Java. Reads from a CSV file that has several properties, and you can iterate through each property using the GUI that pops up. Other features include favouriting properties and viewing properties on Google maps.

This coursework was originally done in BlueJ, but I have ported the project over to IntelliJ.
You can check the assignment-materials folder for the task list and the base code. Try it yourself if you want!
